# Mock up for Information Gatherer PCI
This PCI is a generated mockup with some work already done

## Files that had already been working on
- `js/index.js`: demonstrates what the PCI should do 
- `js/screen.js`: ready for usage
- `js/tao.js`: ready for usage
- `js/env.js`: ready for usage
- `creator/img/icon.svg`: ready for usage
- `readme.md`: ready for usage
- `creator/tpl/markup.tpl`: presumably ready for usage
- `creator/tpl/propertiesForm.tpl`: probably useless, there is no configuration

## Rollup configuration
`npm run pci:build` takes the files under `js` and generates `runtime/js/rollup-renderer.amd.js`
